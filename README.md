# todo-app

While I'm aware this application is a bit stereotypical, it is a great exercise in full-stack
building and learning new back and front end technologies.

## Required technologies to run application
* Git
* Docker
* Docker Compose
* Node
* NPM

## Running the application

To run the application run the following command from the root of this repository:
`bash scripts/start.sh`

The application should automatically open in your default browser but if not you can open it via
`localhost:3000`

## Stopping the application

* Hit `Ctrl+C` in the terminal instance running the `scripts.start.sh` script to bring down the front end
* Run the command `bash scripts/stop.sh` to bring down the database and server docker containers

## Final notes

Thank you for using my application!  As always, feedback and constructive criticism are always welcome!
